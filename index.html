    <h1> US Shopping Analysis Across Regions and Generations </h1>

    <h3> Project Introduction </h3>

    <p>[Intro goes here + links to references]</p>

    <h3>Data Introduction</h3>

    <p>Our analysis makes use of a dataset called "shopping-trends.csv", which contains the following attributes 
        across all 50 states. The data originally has 3900 rows with 19 columns. In order to conduct analysis on 
        the data, we cleaned and added 3 columns to highlight certain information. This included creating "Region",
        "Age Group", and "Winter Items" columns. The starred (*) attributes indicate data that was derived from 
        existing columns. The detailed information about the features are listed in the following table:</p>

    <h3>Map Showing Which Age Group Spends the Most Per State</h3>
        
    <div class = 'center'>
        <iframe src="purchases_per_state.html" width="80%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        <br> The map above shows the total amount spent per state. The lighter the color, the more 
        shopping occurs in that state compared to others. The map is interactive, so you can hover over each state to 
        see more information. When you hover over the box, the "Age Group" shown is the generation that spends the most
        in that state. A quick look at the graph shows that Montana is the lightest colored state, and therefore,
        has the highest spending at $5,784 and Boomers (ages 44+) are the highest spenders by age, spending 56.45% of the
        entire state's purchases. Kansas is the state with the lowest spending at only $3,437, with Boomers once again
        spending the most at 48.3%. The states with the largest cities (i.e. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles) are more lightly
        colored, so there could be a possible correlation between large cities and higher population and it's effect on 
        overall state spending.

    <h3>Summary and Future Additions</h3>
    <p>[AJ thoughts - maybe something about comparing population to spending or states with large cities
        or unemployment levels to spending (ex if more unemployed then maybe less spending)]</p>
